"PARADISE - * this Sunday the 22nd September at 18:00 BST *

As Jellyfish is away this week, I have been put in charge of the movie streaming

**I’ve chosen a great film to stream called paradise **

I can’t remember if I’ve seen a discussion about this before in the movie nights before or not, but not only is this rare as far as longevity media goes as it is a film directly focused on longevity, but it also covers many aspects relevant to longevity too - mainly commercialization, with a heavy focus on financing prevalent throughout society in this film, leading to a have/ have not culture through the way life extension is achieved. As most people in this sector are currently performing a role the government should be performing, this is longevity media that has a high degree of relevance to what we are trying to achieve
",1,Movie stream announcement,General,,,
"We recently streamed a great series of wolverine/ Deadpool films, and not only were these highly entertaining, but while I’ve seen them all before, I was personally surprised at how many great longevity depictions there were when I went back and watched them with the forum
Overall, these movie nights are a great way for those of us interested in the possibilities of longevity science to connect and enjoy the rare, depictions of this profound technology in a shared setting, so it would be great if we could get some more of you to attend these events, and hopefully if you’re seeing this you will be able join us tomorrow.

(I know many of us are very busy, but for those who have lots going on remember you don’t need to sit there watching and do nothing else. For me personally, I know I’m normally working and doing other stuff in the background while these films are playing. Sure we can all watch these things by ourselves, but by coming along to the movie nights it not only gives you a great way to connect with those like you have shared interested in the same thing, but it also means you can chat with like-minded people at the same time in the same too,  and who knows, you might also pick up some nuggets of information in the process!!!)

"Did any of you read this? https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91097.Trouble_with_Lichen

""a young female biochemist who discovers that a chemical extracted from an unusual strain of lichen can be used to slow down the ageing process, enabling people to live to around 200–300 years""",1,Community question,General,,,
"""Trouble with Lichen"" by John Wyndham is a captivating work of speculative fiction that delves into the complexities of human nature, scientific ethics, and societal change. Set in a near-future England, the novel follows the groundbreaking discovery of a lichen species with extraordinary properties. This lichen dramatically slows down the aging process, granting its users extended youth and vitality. At the heart of the story is Diana Brackley, a brilliant and ambitious biochemist who stumbles upon this miraculous lichen. As she grapples with the moral implications of her discovery, she becomes embroiled in a web of intrigue, power struggles, and ethical dilemmas. The narrative skillfully weaves together elements of scientific discovery, corporate greed, and personal ambition, offering a thought-provoking exploration of the consequences of tampering with nature. Through Wyndham's masterful storytelling, ""Trouble with Lichen"" raises profound questions about the pursuit of scientific progress and its impact on humanity. As Diana navigates the treacherous waters of scientific innovation and societal expectations, readers are compelled to reflect on the timeless themes of mortality, identity, and the quest for immortality. Rich in suspense and social commentary, this novel continues to captivate audiences with its timeless relevance and thought-provoking narrative.",3,Community question,General,,,

"I used to read a lot of books but I don't have time to anymore. That book looks really good though.
Science fiction was my favourite genre but I never came across many longevity storylines in them though. One of the last books I read was from Wilbur smith called The Quest, it was set in Egypt and the protagonist Taita finds the 'fountain of youth' which rejuvenates  his old body back to the peak of baseline health...its one of my favourites!

I think its really great that there are people writing about longevity, although sadly it is still a niche when compared with other fields at present

I suppose one good idea it gives me is that it may be good for jellyfishDAO to publish its own book. 
Those who wanted to particapte could contribute about 25 pages each, possibly around various topics, say for instance, around what actions they've taken to help promote longevity science in their lives, like an autobiographical work...its certainly a good idea for publicity for the DAO and would help promote longevity science at the same time...",2,Reaction,General,,,

As far as I can see the only things that give us really impressive results are things like steriods, but they only help keep the body healthy by making it more muscular and wont stop the body from aging.

"Most formats of game wouldn't particularly work, but a visual novel with longevity themes has been a recurring idea in my head. Low (relative) development cost, high focus on narrative and therefore theme and character. Lots of space to explore perspectives on long lives. Transhumanism generally shows up in the genre fairly often.",2,Personal opinion,General,,,
"I've definitely noticed that games are looked upon kindly here, which is good. They're a more important way than ever to penetrate the zeitgeist. 

Another benefit of visual novels is that their fanbases tend to be... dedicated.",4,Personal opinion,General,,,
"I could see a fan of visual novels generally who identifies with a character in our hypothetical game educating themselves (even if only a little) about the real life industry the game is inspired by, and in that way it could be a pipeline to create more longevity enthusiasts. One of the recurring issues after all, is that people do not know legitimate research is being done.",4,Personal opinion,General,,,
"I have a few friends who do or have done game dev who I've bounced this idea off of before who have responded positively. I'll continue to paw the idea around in my head, a good non-preachy narrative with strong characters who don't feel like strawmen arguments for longevity is a key here, and that would take care to do well. But if I have a strong idea, I may begin putting together a team for this, or at least try to formalise a document on it.",4,Personal opinion,General,,,

"Yes its great abit of fantasy written all the back in 2007.

What if we crowdfunded advertisements for our ideas and movement?
F.e. I’d be happy to donate $0.02 for every thousand views of a video or post about indefinite life extension.
Of course $0.02 is very small, but if 200 people contribute similarly, it could become even profitable.

My background is that I made such advertisement with my money about 8 years ago, and my posts got a few million views in my country social network. Eventually, I decided that it's too expensive for me.

You also move slower as you get more age/damage, so my hope was to have a true feeling of that immediate difference from old frailty to young mobility as a longevity mechanic.
